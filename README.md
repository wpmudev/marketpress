### Integration With WPMU DEV Plugins

Take full advantage of the 100+ premium plugins included with your WPMU DEV membership by pairing them with MarketPress. Plus, MarketPress includes special integrations with Appointments + and CoursePress.

## Usage

### To Get Started:

If you're new to WordPress, you'll want to start off by reading the [Installing Plugins](https://wpmudev.com/docs/using-wordpress/installing-wordpress-plugins/) section in our comprehensive [WordPress and WordPress Multisite Manual](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wpmu-manual/), so you can get MarketPress installed on your site properly. Once you've got MarketPress installed and activated, you'll be presented with our Quick Setup wizard. You can skip it if you _really_ want to, but we highly recommend that you follow it all the way through (as it'll make the setup of your store easier): 

![MarketPress - Quick Setup Start](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-quick-setup-start.png)

 We'll start you off with the creation of the store pages, and from there, you'll configure things like:

*   The location of your store
*   Your shipping preferences (where you will ship to, as well as your shipping methods)
*   Your store's currency, and tax preferences
*   Payment gateways (we've got a bunch of those!)

Once you've configured all that, you'll then be presented with the option to either create a new product, or go over the settings in more detail: 

![MarketPress - Quick Setup Complete](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-quick-setup-complete.png)

 Before we go and create a product here, we'll want to touch on some aspects of the settings first.

### A stroll through the Store... Settings

Our friend, the Store Settings tab, houses all of the settings for MarketPress: 

![MarketPress - Store Settings](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-store-settings-tab.png)

 We provide inline documentation for all of the settings inside of MarketPress, but we'll want to touch on a few points in particular, as we go through the setup of this new store. **Digital Downloads** If you're planning on offering digital products in your store, you'll want to review the "Download Settings" section inside of: _Store Settings -> General_ 

![MarketPress - Digital Download Settings](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-digital-download-settings.png)

 From here, you can choose to:

*   Set the maximum amount of times a purchased file can be downloaded
*   Enable MarketPress's alternative download method (for large downloads, like files that are several hundred megabytes in size)
*   Limit the amount of digital products per order

**Google Analytics E-commerce Tracking** If you're already using Google Analytics on your site, you'll be pleased to know that we offer integration with that inside of MarketPress, so you can track your e-commerce activity as well (with no add ons required)! The settings for this integration are also found inside of: _Store Settings -> General_ 

![MarketPress - Google Analytics Integration](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-google-analytics-tracking.png)

 From there, you can configure MarketPress to work with the tracking code in use on your site (whether you're using the old, new, or Universal tracking code). **Store Pages** If you skipped the step earlier in the Quick Setup to create the store pages, you'll really want to head over to the "Store Pages" section inside of: _Store Settings -> Presentation_ And get those pages set up. You can click the "Create Page" button for each store page, and MarketPress will automatically create a page for you: 

![MarketPress - Store Settings - Create Store Pages](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-create-store-pages.png)

 **Product Attributes** Also known as variations within MarketPress (which we'll cover later), this section will allow you to create & modify various attributes for your products (e.g. Color, Size, Weight, etc). You'll also be able to adjust how they're sorted, what they're sorted by, and even add new options to an existing attribute. **Product Categories/Product Tags** As WordPress allows you to create categories & tags for your posts, so too does MarketPress allow you to do the same for your products, via the "Product Categories" & "Product Tags" settings pages. After all, when it comes to making products available, you want to make it easy as possible for a customer to find what he wants. **Capabilities** This section's handy if you're wanting to control how others could manage your store, or even allow someone to manage your whole store, without having to make him an Administrator on your site! Tip: If you're wanting to create a special role for a store admin, you could use a plugin like [User Role Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/) to do just that (an easy way would be to duplicate the "Subscriber" role, and then just assign the desired permissions on the Capabilities page inside of MarketPress). We'll be reviewing some other settings later on, but for now, let's go create our first product!

### Creating Products

In MarketPress, there's three kinds of products available: Physical, Digital, and External. We'll start off here with a physical product (a t-shirt in this example), walking through the various aspects of configuration, and then touch on the unique aspects of both Digital & External products. First on our agenda is the "Product Kind" section, where you can choose the type of product to create. We've already chosen the "Physical / Tangible Product" type here, for our example case: 

![MarketPress - Product Kind](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-product-kind.png)

 Next, we've got the "Price, Inventory & Variants" section. Depending on the type of product chosen in the "Product Kind" section, the options displayed here will vary. Below are the options you'd see when creating a physical product: 

![MarketPress - Prices, Inventory & Variants](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-price-inventory.png)

 Seeing as we're setting up a physical product at the moment, there's a few points to note in this section: _Set up a Sale for this Product:_ If you're planning to run a sale on this product, you'll want to check this option. Plus, you can also specify the period of time that this sale goes on for! _Special Taxes:_ If your product requires a different tax rate than what's specified in your general settings, then you'll want to enter the desired rate here. _Charge Shipping:_ If you're charging for shipping, you'll definitely want to check this box, as you'll then be able to specify the weight for your product (and an additional shipping charge, if you desire). _Track Product Inventory:_ Here, you can set up a quantity for your product (and you can even allow customers to purchase the product when it's out of stock). Now, a bit below this section, you'll also see the "Product Images" section: 

![MarketPress - Product Images](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-product-images.png)

 Here, you can specify one or more images for your product (the first image will be used as the primary image), which will then be displayed as a gallery on your product page. **Variations** Ah, variations... you'll have fun with this one. :) With this, instead of creating several products for each type of a product (e.g. men's shirts, women's shirts, white shirts, etc.), you can turn them into variations inside of a single product! Continuing our t-shirt product example here, you could have one version that's for women, and another for men. Or, to throw another variation type in there, you could offer men's & women's t-shirts, along with small, medium, and large sizes. Or to bring yet _another_ variation type into the mix, you could offer men's & women's t-shirts, in small, medium, and large sizes, _and_ in an array of color options as well! As you can see, there's quite a few possibilities available! :) In the "Add variations for" box, you can create as many names & values as you wish (or choose ones already created, if you did that via the "Product Attributes" page, mentioned earlier), following the directions there: 

![MarketPress - Creating Product Variants](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-product-variants-create.png)

 Once the variations are created/chosen, you'll notice that the "Price, Inventory & Variants" & "Product Image" sections will disappear, and will be replaced by the "Product Variations" section: 

![MarketPress - Product Variants List](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-product-variants-list.png)

 You'll be able to edit all of your variations from here, from adjusting the inventory, changing the variation type, changing the prices, etc. On the far left of this section, you'll be able to specify a product image for each variation listed. Inside the "More" section for a variation (represented by a blue grid on the far right), you'll be able to adjust some additional properties for the variation, that you saw previously in the "Price, Inventory & Variants" section: 

![MarketPress - Product Variant Details](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-product-variant-details.png)

 You'll also be able to add in some additional content for the variation from this section, if you desire. **Related Products** Now, let's look into the future here, and say that your customer's on your product page, checking out those t-shirts of yours. But while he's there, in the related products section, he's seeing... a dress from your store show up there, along with a polka dot tie, and clogs! What if you wanted a pair of jeans to show up there instead, along with some sneakers, and a baseball cap? With this setting, you can pick specific products in your store to show up in the Related Products section, so that instead of a mismatched set of items, you're now leading your customer towards acquiring a complete wardrobe: 

![MarketPress - Related Products](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-related-products.png)

 Congratulations, you've just saved the future! (and all without a time machine) **Categories & Tags** Finally, you can assign categories & tags that you've created for your products, as well as create new ones to assign. Make your products easy to sort through and find, and your customers will thank you. **On Digital Products** With digital products, variations can be specified as well, but instead of having to deal with shipping details, we instead have to specify a file from your site to be assigned to the product. Like physical products, digital products can also have variations, with a separate file assigned to each variation. So if you were selling tax preparation software, you could offer Basic, Premium & Pro editions of the software, each edition as a separate variation. **On External Products** With external products, the sole purpose is to take your customer to an external location (e.g. an affiliate link, another store, etc.), so the options here are minimal. An SKU, price & product image can be set here, as well as a sale price, but the main focus is the "External Link" field, where you'll enter the link to the page to send your customer to.

### Shortcodes

Alright, you've got your products created, but... now you're wanting to show them on more than just your product pages. Maybe you're wanting to show a single product on a page of yours, or perhaps display a list of products that are in a certain category on a page of yours. Not to fear, we've got a handy shortcode generator available in the editor, available via the "Add E-Commerce Short Code" button highlighted in the screenshot below: 

![MarketPress - Shortcode Generator](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-shortcode-generator.png)

 Clicking on that will display a popup, where you can choose from one of the available shortcodes via a dropdown menu: 

![MarketPress - Shortcode Generator Popup](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-shortcode-generator-popup.png)

 When a shortcode is chosen, clicking on each of the "i" icon bubbles will provide additional info about an attribute, so that's what you'll want to be clicking if you're not quite sure what a property does.

### Order History

So, you've now got orders coming in from every Tom, Dick & Harry... let's manage them! From inside of: _Store -> Orders_ You can manage & review all of the orders that have been placed on your site: 

![MarketPress - Orders - Home](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-orders-home.png)

 By hovering over the star icon for an order, you can quickly change the status of an order: 

![MarketPress - Orders - Quick Flag](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-orders-quick-flag.png)

 You can also review an order in detail by clicking on the "Edit" link for a particular order, where you'll see details like:

*   Information about the customer
*   The payment method chosen, and the associated details
*   The shipping and payment history
*   The shipping information (cost of shipping, the method of shipment, and the tracking number

![MarketPress - Order Details](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-order-details.png)

### Add Ons

Found inside of: Store Settings -> Add Ons You'll see the add ons available in MarketPress, which will vary depending on whether you're running a normal WordPress site, or if you're running a Multisite installation. For the "Coupons" add on, you'll see a new sub-entry in the "Store" menu item, from which you can create new coupons: 

![MarketPress - Coupons - Home](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-coupons-home.png)

 You'll notice that when you create a coupon of your own, that there's two notable features:

1.  How should the discount amount be applied? - for this, you can determine whether:
    *   a coupon should be applied to each eligible product, no matter what the quantity is;
    *   a coupon should only be applied once per eligible product (e.g. if you're ordering 10 boxes of chocolates, only the first box will have the discount applied to it)
2.  Can this coupon be combined with other coupons? - Yes, we do allow you to determine whether coupons can be combined with other coupons! (and to further specify which other coupons a coupon can be combined with)

To configure the coupon message displayed to customers on the checkout page, you'll want to click on the "Settings" link for the Coupons add on inside the Add Ons page. For the "Invoice PDF" add on, not only will you be able to automatically send out a PDF invoice with your order emails (and being able to choose emails it's automatically sent out for), but you'll also be able to manually download a PDF invoice for an order, as well as the packing slip for a order, from the Order Details page: 

![MarketPress - Invoice Addon - Export](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-invoice-addon-export-buttons.png)

 The Invoice PDF add on also has it's own settings page, accessible via the Add Ons page, where you can configure things like:

*   How the PDF should be viewed
*   What emails should it be attached to
*   Whether to disable it for free products, or not
*   As well as template settings for the invoice itself

### Using on WordPress Multisite

On Multisite, you can choose to activate MarketPress in one of two ways: **Way #1: Activating MarketPress site-by-site** You would take this route if you wanted to make it a [Pro Sites](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/pro-sites/ "Pro Sites") premium plugin, or you wanted to limit it to specific sites. This means your users:

*   Can choose to activate MarketPress in their subsite dashboards via _Plugins -> Installed Plugins_
*   Can choose to activate any of the payment gateways available in MarketPress.

**Way #2: Network activating MarketPress** This is where MarketPress really gets to shine on Multisite. With this method of activation, you take MarketPress from being a shop-by-shop experience, and convert it into a network wide experience! You can do things like:

*   Have a single, global shopping cart, so visitors to your network can add items from any shop on the network, and check out in a single place
*   Charge a percentage of the profits on a sale, via the PayPal Chained Payments gateway
*   Control access to gateways & CSS themes inside of MarketPress

You'll find all the Multisite options in the Network Dashboard by going to: _Settings -> Store Network_ 

![MarketPress - Store Network - Home](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-store-network-home.png)

 Where you'll see the following sections:

*   General Settings - limit the use of Global Widgets and shortcodes to the main blog and enable Global shopping cart
*   Product Indexer - index all of the products on your network, so that they're visible via the global marketplace
*   Gateway Permissions - provide or restrict access to payment gateways for network stores (an additional Pro Sites option will be provided if the [Pro Sites](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/pro-sites/ "Pro Sites") plugin is installed, more on that in a moment)
*   Global Marketplace Pages - customize your global marketplace, category & tag pages
*   Theme Permissions - provide or restrict access to MarketPress CSS themes for network stores

_Important:_ If the Site Visibility of a sub-site in your network is set to "Discourage search engines..." (under Settings -> Reading), the products from that sub-site will not display in the global marketplace.

### The Global Cart and Chained Payments

The global cart in MarketPress is designed from the ground up to allow each store to be a different merchant, accepting and processing orders independently, yet allowing for a single place on the network for customers to check out. However, it's not designed for the same store owner to run multiple stores, you should just keep your products in one store in that case. Two things to bear in mind about the global cart are:

1.  Due to cross-domain security concerns, the global cart is not compatible with domain mapped sub-sites.
2.  When the global cart is active, only the PayPal Express Checkout gateway is available for use on the network.

Now, regarding chained payments (also known as [parallel payments](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/classic/express-checkout/integration-guide/ECParallelPaymens/ "Parallel payments"))... they're what allows a customer to checkout/pay once for an order, and have the funds automatically distributed to multiple merchants on a marketplace. In the case of MarketPress, we provide this via the PayPal Chained Payments gateway, allowing you, the store network owner, to collect your share of the profits for a sale, while allowing your store owners to be sent the rest. 

![MarketPress - PayPal Chained Payments](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-network-chained-payments.png)

 _Important:_ Please note, that the chained payments functionality is only available through PayPal.

### Pro Sites Integration

With the help of our very own [Pro Sites](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/pro-sites/ "Pro Sites") plugin, you can control access to specific gateways and CSS themes inside of MarketPress in an finer manner, requiring a user to first have a certain Pro Site level. Simply install and configure Pro Sites on your network, setting up various Levels as you want them, as per our [usage page](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/pro-sites/#product-usage). Then, once you've done that, you'll want to into the Dashboard for the main site, and head to: _Store Settings -> Add Ons_ And enable the Pro Sites add-on from there. From the Store Network page inside the Network Dashboard, you'll now see more options inside the dropdown box for access, displaying the Pro Site levels you've configured: 

![MarketPress - Pro Sites Integration](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mp-3006-pro-sites-integration.png)

### Note on caching

If you are using a caching plugin such as W3 Total Cache, or have another caching mechanism such as Varnish enabled on your server, you'll need to add a couple of cookie exceptions for MarketPress to function correctly:

*   PHPSESSID
*   mp_order_history_
*   mp_session
*   mp_globalcart_*

If you are using W3 Total Cache you'll want to add these to the "Rejected cookies" setting (one item per line), inside of: _Performance -> Page Cache -> Advanced_ If your server's using Varnish cache, please contact your hosting provider and ask them to add these exceptions.
